                        TO CHECK FOR STORM DAMAGE

                    <p>
                        After a severe storm, it is always a good idea to have your roof inspected. Even if you don’t see any damage from the ground, there could be damage that is not easily visible. A trained roofing contractor will be able to spot any damage and make the necessary repairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have storm damage, your insurance company will likely cover the cost of repairs. However, you will need to provide them with documentation of the damage. This is where a roofing contractor can be beneficial. They can give you an estimate of the repairs needed and help you file a claim with your insurance company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While dealing with storm damage may seem like a hassle, getting your roof repaired as soon as possible is essential. A damaged roof can further damage your home, so it is best to take care immediately. With the help of a roofing contractor, you can get your roof back in tip-top shape in no time!

                        TO CHECK FOR WEAR AND TEAR

                    <p>
                        Even if your roof wasn’t damaged in a storm, it can still suffer from wear and tear over time. This is especially true if you live in an area with extreme weather conditions. An inspection will allow a contractor to spot potential problems and make repairs before they become more significant issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s also a good idea to have your roof inspected after a storm, even if you don’t think there is any damage. High winds can loosen or dislodge shingles, and heavy rain can cause leaks. An inspection will ensure that your roof is in good condition and identify potential problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you live in an area with severe weather conditions, having your roof inspected at least once a year is essential. This will help ensure that your roof is in good condition and identify potential problems before they become more significant.

                                Most homeowners insurance policies require that you have a yearly roof inspection. If you don’t have one, you could risk your policy being voided or rates going up. Many people don’t realize that their homeowner’s insurance policy has a roofing clause. This clause states that for your policy to remain valid, you must have a yearly roof inspection. If you don’t have one, you could risk your policy being voided or rates going up.
                            </p>

                                Like most people, you probably don’t think about your roof until there’s a problem. But, having a yearly inspection can help you avoid costly repairs down the road. It can also give you peace of mind knowing that your home is protected in an emergency.
                            </p>

                        A roof inspection includes a thorough examination of your roofing system. Your inspector will look for signs of wear and tear, damage, and potential problems. They will also check for proper ventilation and drainage. After the inspection, you will receive a report detailing the condition of your roof.
